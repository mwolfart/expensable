# Expensable

This is an online tool created to manage expenses and savings. The user can log all of their daily expenses, assign them to custom categories and view a monthly or periodic dashboard in order to keep track of financial goals.

The project was designed using Remix, Prisma, MongoDB and TailwindCSS. The main goals here were to A) replace a set of spreadsheets I was using to keep track of my expenses and B) learn Remix and acquire a little bit of experience with MongoDB.

# Usage

In order to use the tool one can create an account through the basic auth form.
For demo purposes, you can also use the account of username `testuser@mailinator.com` and password `Test123!`. This account should already contain some data for you to see.

The application consists of three basic data lists, with CRUD support, and a dashboard. Users can create expenses (individual items), categories (to be used within expenses) and transactions (groups of expenses). The dashboard shows monthly graphs for the data inserted.
