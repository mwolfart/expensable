# Expensable

This is an online tool created to manage expenses and savings. The user can log all of their daily expenses, assign them to custom categories and view a monthly or periodic dashboard in order to keep track of financial goals.

The project was designed using Remix, Prisma, MongoDB and TailwindCSS. The main goals here were to A) replace a set of spreadsheets I was using to keep track of my expenses and B) learn Remix and acquire a little bit of experience with MongoDB.

The status of the project is currently in progress. A few screens are finished but there are more features that need to be finished, and there is also a little bit of technical debt that needs to be addressed. Security is also not very well addressed so the recommendation is not to use it in a serious way right now.
